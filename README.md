# FusionReactor-Log-Headers
Files that offer single-word headers for the various log files in FusionReactor, a monitoring tool for ColdFusion, Lucee, and any Java server. For more on FusionReactor, see http://www.fusion-reactor.com.

These log header files can be valuable when using tools to analyze the logs, such as Microsoft Excel (or OpenOffice Calc) as well as Microsoft Log Parser command line tool. I've written in the past about using such tools or done presentations on them, at both my own site, http://www.carehart.org, and at the webinars area of the FusionReactor site, http://www.fusion-reactor.com/webinars.

Thanks to JCSuthe, who had started this effort in 2015, at the project https://github.com/JCSuthe/Fusion-Reactor-Coldfusion-Log-Tools. I had proposed new header files that he did not have (pretty fundamental ones, like request, jdbc, and resource) and offered pull requests, but after several months of no response, I decided to fork the project. 

I am also removing from here various files he'd created offering SQL for importing the logs into a database. That's an interesting idea, but for now I just want to focus on getting all the logs tracked (and updated, as FusionReactor may update them). I've also renamed the project, accordingly. If somebody wants to take up the effort of creating and updating such SQL scripts for the logs, I would be happy to accept them into the project.
